# Announce My Angenda

"Announce My Agenda" performs the simple task of reading out loud
your daily agenda based on which of your Google calendars you have
selected.  The app currently only supports US and UK English.  It
only reads out loud those meetings you have agreed to attend.  The
voice the App uses to recite your agenda is based on your Android
Text-to-Speech preferences.

This project was never releaseed on the Android store, and I'm no longer
supporting it.

I'm releasing the code as open-source, under the GPLv3 license.

The only derivate works is the icon which was drawing using two
public-domain clip art SVG files: [calendar](http://openclipart.org/detail/6178/spiral_calendar-by-alcaline) and
[speaker](http://openclipart.org/detail/60199/speaker-by-voyeg3r)

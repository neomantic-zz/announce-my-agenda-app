<p>This app performs the simple task of reading out loud your 
 daily agenda based on which of your Google calendars you have selected.  
 The app currently only supports US and UK English.  
 It only reads out loud those meetings you have agreed to attend. 
 The voice the App uses to recite your agenda is based on your
  Android Text-to-Speech preferences.</p>
